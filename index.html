    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>I am a very out-going, friendly and determined person. I have always been confident in my abilities to learn whatever it is that I put my mind to.
        Coming from an immigrant family, I have learned the value of hard work and appreciate everything in life with a brighter viewpoint. I find creative ways
        to solve issues, and am often adopted to be the "leader" of situations due to my ability to remain calm under high stress
        situations and the mentality tht nothing is impossible. 
        I often recall upon a quote I heard, "If physics say its possible, physicist will find a way", and I apply to it any situation that may arise. </p>
